# week4_pytorch
Practice and learning materials for PyTorch – Week 4. 
* Exploring core concepts and building skills through hands-on exercises.
## 🌐 Overview
This repository contains practical code implementations and concept notes from a comprehensive PyTorch beginner course by Aladdin Persson. The course is designed to help beginners build a solid foundation in deep learning using PyTorch — a widely-used open-source machine learning library.

Throughout the course, key building blocks such as tensors, autograd, neural network modeling, computer vision tasks, and custom dataset loading are explored. The exercises and examples here are intended to reinforce these core ideas through hands-on practice.

### 💡 Learning Strategies

* Concept First: Understand the "why" behind each step

* Code Along: Type out each example to build muscle memory

* Test Ideas: Modify parameters and observe the results

* Take Notes: Write down what each function or method does

* Use Visuals: Plot results or intermediate tensors for clarity
